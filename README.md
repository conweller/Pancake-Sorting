# Pancake problem Solution

This programming provides multiple approaches to solving the pancake problem,
including a depth first search, a uniform cost search, a greedy search, and an
A * search. As of right now it only works with a pancake stack of size 4, but it
will work with larger stacks if the necessary assert statement are removed from
`main.py`.

## Usage
Compile and run with:
```
python3 main.py
```

If a command line argument is given in the form of ####x
the search algorithm represented by x will be performed
on the stack of pancakes represented by ####.

The search algorithm characters are as follows:


If no argument is given, the program will prompt the user
to enter input in the form of ####x.
